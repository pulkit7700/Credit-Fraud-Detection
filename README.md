# Self-Organizing Maps for Fraud Account Detection in Credit Card Applications Dataset

![Fraud Detection](https://example.com/fraud_detection_image.png)

This repository contains code and resources for using Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) to detect fraud accounts in a credit card applications dataset. The SOM algorithm is a powerful tool for unsupervised learning that can help identify patterns and anomalies in data.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the Credit Card Applications dataset, which contains various features related to credit card applications, such as income, age, credit score, and more. The dataset is provided in the `data` directory.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pulkit7700/Credit-Fraud-Detection.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the SOM algorithm on the dataset:

   ```bash
   python som_fraud_detection.py
   ```

2. The algorithm will train the SOM and generate a visual representation of the fraud detection results.

## Results

The SOM algorithm analyzes the credit card applications dataset and creates a map of neurons, each representing a specific cluster of data points. By identifying outliers and deviations from normal patterns, the SOM algorithm can highlight potential fraud accounts.
